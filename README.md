This study uses a dataset of traffic accidents that occurred between January and August 2020. The goal is to analyze traffic accidents in New York City to help prevent future accidents or reduce their negative impacts. The dataset includes both the accident street and intersection data, which is crucial for location identification.

During this period, 74,881 accidents were reported, of which 135 were fatal, and 548 involved at least 3 injuries. This study focuses on fatal accidents and those with 3 or more injuries. After removing intersections between these two groups, the analysis was conducted on 677 cases.

The prospect of saving even one life or preventing an accident through the measures informed by this study was a key motivator. The results of the study will be shared as open data.
